# Phase 0 — Baseline and success criteria

Phase 0 locks a **reproducible reference** before scaling data, windows, or model size. Use it to answer “did the change help?” without guessing.

## How to record a baseline run

1. From the repo root, with your venv active:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python sandbox.py --baseline-out docs/BASELINE_LAST_RUN.txt
   ```

   Add any flags you use in production (e.g. trajectory mode, LR schedule, CSV logging):

   ```bash
   python sandbox.py \
     --epoch-metrics-csv metrics.csv \
     --log-hard-batch-loss-above 0.22 \
     --lr 0.001 \
     --lr-decay-every 15 \
     --lr-gamma 0.7 \
     --epochs 25 \
     --baseline-out docs/BASELINE_LAST_RUN.txt
   ```

2. The script prints a **Phase 0 baseline** block at the end (metrics + three fixed generations). `--baseline-out` saves that block to a file for git or notes.

3. Copy the printed block into the **“Recorded baseline”** section below when you want a frozen snapshot in git.

For growing the training set before serious baselines, see **[CORPUS_SCALING.md](CORPUS_SCALING.md)**.

**Fixed generation prompts** (defined in `sandbox.py` as `BASELINE_PROMPT_1` … `BASELINE_PROMPT_3`) are always the same so outputs are comparable across runs.

## Metrics to care about

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| **train_CE** (last epoch) | Cross-entropy from readout on training windows, eval-style. Compare across runs. |
| **val_CE** (last epoch) | Held-out lines. **Ignore absolute value** when the validation split is tiny (e.g. 2 lines); use trend after scale-up. |
| **mean_loss** (last epoch) | With `--loss-mode trajectory` (default): training step objective (trajectory contrastive + optional aux CE), **not** `CE − entropy`. |
| **train_traj_contrast** / **val_traj_contrast** | Mean trajectory contrastive term; auxiliary signal for geometry. |
| **mean_final_T** | Mean window tension at the **last** adaptive dynamics step each epoch—track drift vs epoch via `--epoch-metrics-csv`. |

Architecture changes will change absolute numbers—re-record baseline after major `sandbox.py` updates.

## v1 scale-up success check (agreed criteria)

Treat a change as **successful for v1** when **both** hold:

1. **Calibration:** **val_CE** is **lower than this baseline** (same seed/split settings), or at least not worse while **train_CE** improves — i.e. no clear collapse to memorized noise. Only meaningful once the val set has **enough windows**.
2. **Subjective quality:** On the **three fixed prompts**, text shows **less pointless repetition** than the baseline generations, without becoming random gibberish.

Optional: note wall time and epoch count if you change data size or model size.

## Recorded baseline

Official snapshot from a **trajectory-mode** run on the default corpus (CPU, seed 42). Command:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python sandbox.py \
  --epoch-metrics-csv metrics.csv \
  --log-hard-batch-loss-above 0.22 \
  --lr 0.001 \
  --lr-decay-every 15 \
  --lr-gamma 0.7
```

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Date (UTC) | 2026-03-28T15:49:20+00:00 |
| Git commit (training run) | `6858eca` |
| Git commit (docs + trajectory `sandbox.py` on `main`) | `1685e55` |
| Corpus | `data/corpus.txt` — 51 lines loaded, 49 usable (≥7 in-vocab tokens), 2 train / val lines for val split |
| Last epoch | 25/25 |
| Windows per epoch | 180 |
| `mean_loss` (objective) | 0.1737 |
| `train_CE` | 0.6365 |
| `val_CE` | 7.9570 (noisy) |
| `train_traj_contrast` | 0.046814 |
| `val_traj_contrast` | 0.200000 |
| Train wall time (total pre-training) | 718.7 s |
| Notes | LR stepped down with `StepLR` every 15 epochs (`lr-gamma` 0.7). Window dynamics often used all 16 steps (`MAX_WINDOW_STEPS`) because geometry tension stayed above early-exit tolerance. |

### Debug attractor (representative)

One prompt with `log_dynamics`-style metrics at end of training:

- **Tension curve:** monotone decay over 16 steps (example final values ~0.24–0.29), not oscillatory.
- **mean_var** (token variance across positions): ~0.00155 — still low; differentiation remains the main qualitative bottleneck at tiny data scale.
- **mean_cos(step):** ~0.998 — smooth step-to-step updates.
- **compare_prompts** (order sensitivity): e.g. L2(window) ~3.0–3.3, cosine ~0.12–0.25 between reordered same-word prompts.

## Example row (illustrative only)

Older CE-only runs might show different `mean_loss` semantics. After scaling data, you want **train_CE** and (with a real val split) **val_CE** to move together sensibly, and the three prompt outputs to read **less repetitively** than the snapshot above.
